Ruth Keidel Clemens grew up in the Democratic Republic of Congo as a child of Mennonite missionaries. She and her husband served with Mennonite Central Committee in Cambodia where they started their family, and experienced interesting political change, from a U.S.-led embargo to “democracy”. She works with Mennonite Central Committee as Program Director. These stories arise primarily out of her experiences in Congo and Cambodia.
