<p>During that time of service in Cambodia 1988-1993 we observed a society&rsquo;s transition from a very restrictive socialist regime to &ldquo;democratic&rdquo; capitalism in all its beauty&hellip;.</p>

<p>There were major political and world events that affected the political situation in Cambodia in major ways, and our work between 1988 and 1993. &nbsp;From Communist government with embargo from the West, through peace talks, return of Prince Sihanouk, to the largest international peacekeeping force ever, who conducted a civil process of education on the election process, to democratic elections in 1993, the first democratic elections since 1976.</p>

<p>All looks like positive movement toward peace, right?</p>

<p>Looking at the economic transitions of this time&hellip;</p>

<p>1988&mdash;embargo from West, no multilateral aid from the West. Lots of poverty, but everyone was on an equal footing (except those at the very top). Most people had food to eat.</p>

<p>1992&mdash;embargo was lifted, multi-lateral aid from the West was allowed, could see things opening up economically. But the greedy could also run rampant, and the rich started becoming richer, and the poor poorer. And what happened in between?&nbsp;</p>

<p>1988: Vietnamese backed Communist gov&rsquo;t; U.S. led embargo from West</p>

<p>1989: Fall of Berlin Wall &amp; Break up of Soviet Union</p>

<p>1991: Peace Accords/Sihanouk&rsquo;s return</p>

<p>1992: U.S. lifts trade embargo on Cambodia</p>

<p>Refugee camps on Thai border begin to close/Influx of NGOs to Phnom Penh</p>

<p>Begin the rise of capitalism in Cambodia</p>

<p>1992-3: UNTAC&rsquo;s 20,000 international peacekeepers, leading to elections</p>

We had to get special permission from the US State Dept to go to Cambodia.</p>

<p>There were 14 Americans and 80 Westerners in all of Cambodia in 1988 when we arrived. There were thousands of Soviet block country citizens providing assistance in the country.</p>

<p>When we first arrived, Phnom Penh seemed quiet and calm and quaint. Yet we soon became aware that the Cambodian people felt extremely isolated from the West. Flying into PPn felt like going into a hole, cut off from the world. Of course this was before the internet, but there was also no postal system&mdash;communication in and out once/week with a mail pouch processed from Bangkok, and the banking system was dysfunctional in the country.&nbsp;</p>
