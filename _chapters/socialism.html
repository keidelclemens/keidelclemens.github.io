<p>During that time of service in Cambodia 1988-1993 we observed a society&rsquo;s transition from a very restrictive socialist regime to &ldquo;democratic&rdquo; capitalism in all its beauty&hellip;.</p>

<p>There were major political and world events that affected the political situation in Cambodia in major ways, and our work between 1988 and 1993. &nbsp;From Communist government with embargo from the West, through peace talks, return of Prince Sihanouk, to the largest international peacekeeping force ever, who conducted a civil process of education on the election process, to democratic elections in 1993, the first democratic elections since 1976.</p>

<p>All looks like positive movement toward peace, right?</p>

<p>Looking at the economic transitions of this time&hellip;</p>

<p>1988&mdash;embargo from West, no multilateral aid from the West. Lots of poverty, but everyone was on an equal footing (except those at the very top). Most people had food to eat.</p>

<p>1992&mdash;embargo was lifted, multi-lateral aid from the West was allowed, could see things opening up economically. But the greedy could also run rampant, and the rich started becoming richer, and the poor poorer. And what happened in between?&nbsp;</p>

<p>1988: Vietnamese backed Communist gov&rsquo;t; U.S. led embargo from West</p>

<p>1989: Fall of Berlin Wall &amp; Break up of Soviet Union</p>

<p>1991: Peace Accords/Sihanouk&rsquo;s return</p>

<p>1992: U.S. lifts trade embargo on Cambodia</p>

<p>Refugee camps on Thai border begin to close/Influx of NGOs to Phnom Penh</p>

<p>Begin the rise of capitalism in Cambodia</p>

<p>1992-3: UNTAC&rsquo;s 20,000 international peacekeepers, leading to elections</p>

We had to get special permission from the US State Dept to go to Cambodia.</p>

<p>There were 14 Americans and 80 Westerners in all of Cambodia in 1988 when we arrived. There were thousands of Soviet block country citizens providing assistance in the country.</p>

<p>When we first arrived, Phnom Penh seemed quiet and calm and quaint. Yet we soon became aware that the Cambodian people felt extremely isolated from the West. Flying into PPn felt like going into a hole, cut off from the world. Of course this was before the internet, but there was also no postal system&mdash;communication in and out once/week with a mail pouch processed from Bangkok, and the banking system was dysfunctional in the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the socialist regime, Cambodians were closely watched, not allowed to &ldquo;fraternize&rdquo; with Westerners, and if they were seen talking to us in public for too long, they were often visited by the ministry of interior at night and threatened, sometimes sent to reeducation camp.</p>

<p>We were not allowed to study Khmer, to maintain this distance from Cambodians. Our main friends were the guides who were assigned to us from the various ministries we worked with. We would travel with these guides, who spoke very good English, and got to know each other very well, and became close friends. &nbsp;These were the doctors&nbsp;Jonathan worked with once/week, and the Ministry of Health guide, Bunry with his back to the camera, who became our closest friend, and eventually worked for us in our office.</p>

<p><img alt="" height="426" src="http://i.imgur.com/5jNTx6N.jpg" style="float:left" width="600" />These doctors were employed by the government, but weren&rsquo;t paid regularly, so they each had their own practice out of their homes. They didn&rsquo;t regularly show up at the hospital, because there wasn&rsquo;t a lot of incentive to invest their time when they weren&rsquo;t paid for the job.</p>

<p>Young Cambodians were hungry for relationships with foreigners, but they had to be very careful.</p>

<p>To meet regular people, we jogged every afternoon after work at the <img alt="" height="335" src="http://i.imgur.com/DpMyXA1.jpg" style="float:right" width="500" />Olympic Stadium. We&rsquo;d bike there, and young men would bike up alongside us, or jog beside us at the stadium, and ask, &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; &ldquo;What is your function?&rdquo; &hellip;the first two sentences of &ldquo;Basic English Book 1&rdquo;&hellip;</p>

<p>We were spied on regularly: a young man spied on us regularly at the university while we came for our Khmer lesson; Guys across the street from the office watching us from ministry of interior after MCCer in VN Miriam Buckwalter was kicked out of VN</p>

<p>These restrictions of relationships during the socialist regime, gradually thawed as the embargo was lifted and capitalism took the day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At first we weren&rsquo;t allowed to hire Cambodians into our NGOs. But as things opened up, we were allowed to hire Cambodians to work with us in our office. Mony Ratana was one of the first people we hired in 1991. She learned to do our book keeping and manage the office. Before she came to MCC, she had been serving tea to the men at the Ministry of Agriculture, even though she had a college degree in Ag.</p>

<p><img alt="" height="300" src="http://i.imgur.com/kM3uYAr.jpg" style="float:left" width="400" />When I looked her up again in 2014 she said to me, &ldquo;This morning I told my daughter, I&rsquo;m going to meet the woman who taught me everything I needed to know about administration.&rdquo; &nbsp;Since her time with MCC, she has worked in a variety of project management roles with various UN agencies, foreign embassies, and government ministries.</p>

<p>Moving from a socialist government to a capitalist one has opened up opportunities for some of these more educated women to develop their leadership skills.</p>
