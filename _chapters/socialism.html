<p>During that time of service in Cambodia 1988-1993 we observed a society&rsquo;s transition from a very restrictive socialist regime to &ldquo;democratic&rdquo; capitalism in all its beauty&hellip;.</p>

<p>There were major political and world events that affected the political situation in Cambodia in major ways, and our work between 1988 and 1993. &nbsp;From Communist government with embargo from the West, through peace talks, return of Prince Sihanouk, to the largest international peacekeeping force ever, who conducted a civil process of education on the election process, to democratic elections in 1993, the first democratic elections since 1976.</p>

<p>All looks like positive movement toward peace, right?</p>

<p>Looking at the economic transitions of this time&hellip;</p>

<p>1988&mdash;embargo from West, no multilateral aid from the West. Lots of poverty, but everyone was on an equal footing (except those at the very top). Most people had food to eat.</p>

<p>1992&mdash;embargo was lifted, multi-lateral aid from the West was allowed, could see things opening up economically. But the greedy could also run rampant, and the rich started becoming richer, and the poor poorer. And what happened in between?&nbsp;</p>

<p>1988: Vietnamese backed Communist gov&rsquo;t; U.S. led embargo from West</p>

<p>1989: Fall of Berlin Wall &amp; Break up of Soviet Union</p>

<p>1991: Peace Accords/Sihanouk&rsquo;s return</p>

<p>1992: U.S. lifts trade embargo on Cambodia</p>

<p>Refugee camps on Thai border begin to close/Influx of NGOs to Phnom Penh</p>

<p>Begin the rise of capitalism in Cambodia</p>

<p>1992-3: UNTAC&rsquo;s 20,000 international peacekeepers, leading to elections</p>
