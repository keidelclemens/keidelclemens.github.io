<p><strong>Trip to Africa</strong></p>

<p><strong>July 2012</strong></p>

<p><strong>Ruth, Jonathan, Hana</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Sunday July 1, 2012</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We pulled out of Baltimore in the afternoon leaving a house that had no power. A few nights before, a storm, called a &ldquo;derecho&rdquo; had come up suddenly. I was home with Chris, and the freight train-sounding wind arose in the evening. Chris came downstairs asking what was going on. The strong steady winds (about 80 mph) had come up without warning, lasted a few hours along with a most spectacular thunder and lightning storm, knocking over trees and large branches&mdash;hence no electricity. The evening before we left, with no power, we all (all six of us) took a walk around our neighborhood in the dusk. When there is no power, there is also no internet, no computers, etc. So we are able to do things like take walks and have an evening candlelight cookout. On Sunday AM our brunch together was pizza and bacon, trying to use up perishables in our fridge. Since there there was no coffee-maker, Carla and Hana went looking for a cappuccino, unsuccessfully.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Andy drove us to Dulles, with Carla helping in the navigation. This was practice for our plans for him to pick us on at the end of July. There was a (sort of gruesome) motorcycle accident on I-83 that we passed on the way which put me a bit on edge. There were still lots of tree branches, etc. remaining to drive around as we left the neighborhood and many traffic lights out. Andy did a good job driving us and he will have the GPS when he comes again to get us.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At Dulles we found a Chipotle restaurant and Hana was happy to get her belly full of burrito before taking off for Johannesburg. She also got a chance to watch the ending of the Spain-Italy European cup soccer match which her team, Spain, won handily. I spoke with my friend, Tom Openshaw, in the airport before taking off. He noted that we must have &ldquo;nerves of steel&rdquo; to leave our three young adult children at home for a month. Maybe so. . . .</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The flight went well and, after a re-fueling stop in Dakar, Senegal (where we weren&rsquo;t allowed to get off the plane) we made it to Johannesburg in about 17 hours total. After we landed, the pilot announced that it had been a &ldquo;fully automated landing.&rdquo; I am sure that it was a safe landing, using the computers instead of a pilot, but I am glad that they waited until we were on the ground to announce it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our flight from Dulles had been pushed back several hours, meaning that we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to catch the flight to Zambia immediately from Johannesburg as we had planned. South African Airlines put us up in a hotel near the airport and arranged a flight the next day, and it all worked out. We stayed at the Summer Sun hotel and rugby was on tv in the lobby. Sports seem to be of above average importance in South Africa. Bruno Baerg, Southern Africa MCC Area Director, came by to greet us and to pick up a suitcase that we wouldn&rsquo;t need in Zambia.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We noticed on Weather.com that the forecast for Baltimore for the next five days predicted highs of 98/99/102/98/97. Johannesburg is cool, it is the &ldquo;winter&rdquo; here and we pitied the folks we left behind on the east coast.</p>

<p><strong>Monday, July 2</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because of the time changes, we arrived in J-burg on Monday evening, July 2 at the O.R. Tamba airport. Ruth and I took a walk along the streets near the hotel, not a wonderful scenic walk but we got outside and I enjoyed breathing the air of Africa for the first time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I read about Dr. Livingstone and Mr. Stanley and am looking forward to seeing Victoria Falls, the name of the spectacular falls on the Zambezi River given by Dr. Livingstone. The previous indigenous name had been &ldquo;Mosi-oa-Tunya&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The Smoke that Thunders.&rdquo; I read also that Dr. Livingstone died looking for the source of the Nile, and his heart was excised from his body and buried in Zambia, while his body was taken overland and then by boat back to England.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Tuesday, July 3</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>enjoyed a delicious buffet breakfast in the Summer Sun hotel restaurant, really good! Also in the large restaurant were a number of busloads of S. African school children&mdash;showing fine behavior and enjoying their food. We wondered where they came from and how it was arranged that came to eat at this hotel.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>took the shuttle back to the O.R. Tamba airport and went through the security and other check ins there. I bought a zebra print tie and Hana bought a belt, she had forgotten to bring one along. The airport in J-burg is highly organized and efficient, no problems at all. We saw a sign advertising Bankers without Borders and wondered what kind of an organization that was. Our flight was upgraded to business class, so we basked in the luxury of more leg room, better food and service, more smiles from the stewardesses, etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>we approached Livingstone, Zambia, we could see the Victoria Falls from the air, fanning out as the Zambezi River approached the broad drop off. It is on the border of Zimbabwe with Zambia, and we planned to explore it from the Zambian side. Our home base was to be a rustic hotel/hostel called Jollyboys. We landed at Harry Mwaanga Knumbula International Airport. The bathrooms signs said Ladies and Gents. After changing money ($ 100 US = 500,000 Zambian kwacha&mdash;a kwacha is the Zambian fish eagle, the national bird) we took the shuttle bus to our hotel. Jollyboys has private rooms, all at ground level and also spaces for tents. The rooms were very basic&mdash;cold showers, mosquito nets over the beds, no AC. During the latter part of our stay a high school group from S. Africa pitched their tents&mdash;about 10 tents for maybe thirty young adults, generally well behaved&mdash;in the courtyard of the hotel. The staff was helpful and it was just the kind of place that we were hoping for.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jollyboys (we never did find out where that name comes from) receptionist called a cab for us&mdash;the cabbie was named Victor&mdash;and he drove us to the Victoria Falls. When he dropped us off we set up a time when he would meet us again, at the end of the day. Surprisingly to us, there weren&rsquo;t hordes of tourists. I guess the &ldquo;off-the-beaten-track&rdquo; nature of the Falls explained that. It was spectacular. The bottled water sold at the stands was called &ldquo;Taste the Thunder.&rdquo; And the Falls certainly did thunder. The water falls over 108 meters and the expanse of the Falls, spreading from Zambia to Zimbabwe, was almost 2 km distance. There are 8-9 separate falls, and the full distance across at the rim is about nine kilometers. It is hard to see the whole falls from one end to the other.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ruth, Hana and I hiked along a trail overlooking the gorge in which the Falls descends and got lots of photos. The woodlands beside the trail was habitat for a bunch of chimpanzees who call that area their home. We were warned not to get out any food during this hike because these hungry chimps try to steal it and get aggressive doing so.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other hikes we took included one that involved a steep descent into what was called the Boiling Pot. It has this name because the torrents of water form a cauldron of sorts at the base, the water swirls and seems to boil. Of course, the noise was deafening.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We also took a hike along the Knife&rsquo;s Edge, a path and suspension bridge right along the falls. We rented rain ponchos but in spite of those ponchos we still got plenty wet. The rainbows were constant and we got a lot of photos again, risking getting our camera&rsquo;s wet!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>After perusing the strip of souvenir shops (and owners insistently pursuing our business) Victor brought us back to the hotel. We had supper there, fairly tired after the day of hiking and remarking on the incredible views we had of these Falls. Even Ruth, having grown up in Africa, had not yet seen them. The weather was cool (this was &ldquo;winter&rdquo; in the southern hemisphere) so the Knife&rsquo;s Edge hike had chilled us. We had some hot tea which helped.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The hotel restaurant had the tv on, showing Zambian news. One of the news features was a visit that George W. and Laura Bush were making to Zambia to open up a health clinic. Another news story had to do with plans to &ldquo;re-base the kwacha&rdquo;, that is, take three zeros off of the various denominations. Yet another story that was big was about a copper scandal&mdash;copper is a major export of Zambia, which shares the copper belt with Congo.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our plans for next day, we decided, would be to go on a safari in Botswana to see some large African animals. We signed up at the Jollyboys desk.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Wednesday, July 4</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We were picked up early in the morning and, half asleep with passports in hand, and took a bus ride westward along the border of Zambia and Zimbabwe. We arrived at a ferry crossing town (it reminded me of Neak Loeung in Cambodia&mdash;rough, dusty, full of enterprising people all either trying to get across the river on the ferry or trying to make money from the people who were waiting to cross). This location was right at the point where four African countries come together, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Namibia and</p>

<p>Andy drove us to Dulles, with Carla helping in the navigation. This was practice for our plans for him to pick us on at the end of July. There was a (sort of gruesome) motorcycle accident on I-83 that we passed on the way which put me a bit on edge. There were still lots of tree branches, etc. remaining to drive around as we left the neighborhood and many traffic lights out. Andy did a good job driving us and he will have the GPS when he comes again to get us.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At Dulles we found a Chipotle restaurant and Hana was happy to get her belly full of burrito before taking off for Johannesburg. She also got a chance to watch the ending of the Spain-Italy European cup soccer match which her team, Spain, won handily. I spoke with my friend, Tom Openshaw, in the airport before taking off. He noted that we must have &ldquo;nerves of steel&rdquo; to leave our three young adult children at home for a month. Maybe so. . . .</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The flight went well and, after a re-fueling stop in Dakar, Senegal (where we weren&rsquo;t allowed to get off the plane) we made it to Johannesburg in about 17 hours total. After we landed, the pilot announced that it had been a &ldquo;fully automated landing.&rdquo; I am sure that it was a safe landing, using the computers instead of a pilot, but I am glad that they waited until we were on the ground to announce it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our flight from Dulles had been pushed back several hours, meaning that we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to catch the flight to Zambia immediately from Johannesburg as we had planned. South African Airlines put us up in a hotel near the airport and arranged a flight the next day, and it all worked out. We stayed at the Summer Sun hotel and rugby was on tv in the lobby. Sports seem to be of above average importance in South Africa. Bruno Baerg, Southern Africa MCC Area Director, came by to greet us and to pick up a suitcase that we wouldn&rsquo;t need in Zambia.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We noticed on Weather.com that the forecast for Baltimore for the next five days predicted highs of 98/99/102/98/97. Johannesburg is cool, it is the &ldquo;winter&rdquo; here and we pitied the folks we left behind on the east coast.</p>

<p><strong>Monday, July 2</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because of the time changes, we arrived in J-burg on Monday evening, July 2 at the O.R. Tamba airport. Ruth and I took a walk along the streets near the hotel, not a wonderful scenic walk but we got outside and I enjoyed breathing the air of Africa for the first time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I read about Dr. Livingstone and Mr. Stanley and am looking forward to seeing Victoria Falls, the name of the spectacular falls on the Zambezi River given by Dr. Livingstone. The previous indigenous name had been &ldquo;Mosi-oa-Tunya&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The Smoke that Thunders.&rdquo; I read also that Dr. Livingstone died looking for the source of the Nile, and his heart was excised from his body and buried in Zambia, while his body was taken overland and then by boat back to England.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Tuesday, July 3</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>enjoyed a delicious buffet breakfast in the Summer Sun hotel restaurant, really good! Also in the large restaurant were a number of busloads of S. African school children&mdash;showing fine behavior and enjoying their food. We wondered where they came from and how it was arranged that came to eat at this hotel.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>took the shuttle back to the O.R. Tamba airport and went through the security and other check ins there. I bought a zebra print tie and Hana bought a belt, she had forgotten to bring one along. The airport in J-burg is highly organized and efficient, no problems at all. We saw a sign advertising Bankers without Borders and wondered what kind of an organization that was. Our flight was upgraded to business class, so we basked in the luxury of more leg room, better food and service, more smiles from the stewardesses, etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>we approached Livingstone, Zambia, we could see the Victoria Falls from the air, fanning out as the Zambezi River approached the broad drop off. It is on the border of Zimbabwe with Zambia, and we planned to explore it from the Zambian side. Our home base was to be a rustic hotel/hostel called Jollyboys. We landed at Harry Mwaanga Knumbula International Airport. The bathrooms signs said Ladies and Gents. After changing money ($ 100 US = 500,000 Zambian kwacha&mdash;a kwacha is the Zambian fish eagle, the national bird) we took the shuttle bus to our hotel. Jollyboys has private rooms, all at ground level and also spaces for tents. The rooms were very basic&mdash;cold showers, mosquito nets over the beds, no AC. During the latter part of our stay a high school group from S. Africa pitched their tents&mdash;about 10 tents for maybe thirty young adults, generally well behaved&mdash;in the courtyard of the hotel. The staff was helpful and it was just the kind of place that we were hoping for.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jollyboys (we never did find out where that name comes from) receptionist called a cab for us&mdash;the cabbie was named Victor&mdash;and he drove us to the Victoria Falls. When he dropped us off we set up a time when he would meet us again, at the end of the day. Surprisingly to us, there weren&rsquo;t hordes of tourists. I guess the &ldquo;off-the-beaten-track&rdquo; nature of the Falls explained that. It was spectacular. The bottled water sold at the stands was called &ldquo;Taste the Thunder.&rdquo; And the Falls certainly did thunder. The water falls over 108 meters and the expanse of the Falls, spreading from Zambia to Zimbabwe, was almost 2 km distance. There are 8-9 separate falls, and the full distance across at the rim is about nine kilometers. It is hard to see the whole falls from one end to the other.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ruth, Hana and I hiked along a trail overlooking the gorge in which the Falls descends and got lots of photos. The woodlands beside the trail was habitat for a bunch of chimpanzees who call that area their home. We were warned not to get out any food during this hike because these hungry chimps try to steal it and get aggressive doing so.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other hikes we took included one that involved a steep descent into what was called the Boiling Pot. It has this name because the torrents of water form a cauldron of sorts at the base, the water swirls and seems to boil. Of course, the noise was deafening.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We also took a hike along the Knife&rsquo;s Edge, a path and suspension bridge right along the falls. We rented rain ponchos but in spite of those ponchos we still got plenty wet. The rainbows were constant and we got a lot of photos again, risking getting our camera&rsquo;s wet!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>After perusing the strip of souvenir shops (and owners insistently pursuing our business) Victor brought us back to the hotel. We had supper there, fairly tired after the day of hiking and remarking on the incredible views we had of these Falls. Even Ruth, having grown up in Africa, had not yet seen them. The weather was cool (this was &ldquo;winter&rdquo; in the southern hemisphere) so the Knife&rsquo;s Edge hike had chilled us. We had some hot tea which helped.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The hotel restaurant had the tv on, showing Zambian news. One of the news features was a visit that George W. and Laura Bush were making to Zambia to open up a health clinic. Another news story had to do with plans to &ldquo;re-base the kwacha&rdquo;, that is, take three zeros off of the various denominations. Yet another story that was big was about a copper scandal&mdash;copper is a major export of Zambia, which shares the copper belt with Congo.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our plans for next day, we decided, would be to go on a safari in Botswana to see some large African animals. We signed up at the Jollyboys desk.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Wednesday, July 4</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We were picked up early in the morning and, half asleep with passports in hand, and took a bus ride westward along the border of Zambia and Zimbabwe. We arrived at a ferry crossing town (it reminded me of Neak Loeung in Cambodia&mdash;rough, dusty, full of enterprising people all either trying to get across the river on the ferry or trying to make money from the people who were waiting to cross). This location was right at the point where four African countries come together, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Namibia and</p>
