<p><strong>Trip to Africa</strong></p>

<p><strong>July 2012</strong></p>

<p><strong>Ruth, Jonathan, Hana</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Sunday July 1, 2012</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We pulled out of Baltimore in the afternoon leaving a house that had no power. A few nights before, a storm, called a &ldquo;derecho&rdquo; had come up suddenly. I was home with Chris, and the freight train-sounding wind arose in the evening. Chris came downstairs asking what was going on. The strong steady winds (about 80 mph) had come up without warning, lasted a few hours along with a most spectacular thunder and lightning storm, knocking over trees and large branches&mdash;hence no electricity. The evening before we left, with no power, we all (all six of us) took a walk around our neighborhood in the dusk. When there is no power, there is also no internet, no computers, etc. So we are able to do things like take walks and have an evening candlelight cookout. On Sunday AM our brunch together was pizza and bacon, trying to use up perishables in our fridge. Since there there was no coffee-maker, Carla and Hana went looking for a cappuccino, unsuccessfully.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Andy drove us to Dulles, with Carla helping in the navigation. This was practice for our plans for him to pick us on at the end of July. There was a (sort of gruesome) motorcycle accident on I-83 that we passed on the way which put me a bit on edge. There were still lots of tree branches, etc. remaining to drive around as we left the neighborhood and many traffic lights out. Andy did a good job driving us and he will have the GPS when he comes again to get us.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At Dulles we found a Chipotle restaurant and Hana was happy to get her belly full of burrito before taking off for Johannesburg. She also got a chance to watch the ending of the Spain-Italy European cup soccer match which her team, Spain, won handily. I spoke with my friend, Tom Openshaw, in the airport before taking off. He noted that we must have &ldquo;nerves of steel&rdquo; to leave our three young adult children at home for a month. Maybe so. . . .</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The flight went well and, after a re-fueling stop in Dakar, Senegal (where we weren&rsquo;t allowed to get off the plane) we made it to Johannesburg in about 17 hours total. After we landed, the pilot announced that it had been a &ldquo;fully automated landing.&rdquo; I am sure that it was a safe landing, using the computers instead of a pilot, but I am glad that they waited until we were on the ground to announce it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our flight from Dulles had been pushed back several hours, meaning that we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to catch the flight to Zambia immediately from Johannesburg as we had planned. South African Airlines put us up in a hotel near the airport and arranged a flight the next day, and it all worked out. We stayed at the Summer Sun hotel and rugby was on tv in the lobby. Sports seem to be of above average importance in South Africa. Bruno Baerg, Southern Africa MCC Area Director, came by to greet us and to pick up a suitcase that we wouldn&rsquo;t need in Zambia.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We noticed on Weather.com that the forecast for Baltimore for the next five days predicted highs of 98/99/102/98/97. Johannesburg is cool, it is the &ldquo;winter&rdquo; here and we pitied the folks we left behind on the east coast.</p>

<p><strong>Monday, July 2</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because of the time changes, we arrived in J-burg on Monday evening, July 2 at the O.R. Tamba airport. Ruth and I took a walk along the streets near the hotel, not a wonderful scenic walk but we got outside and I enjoyed breathing the air of Africa for the first time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I read about Dr. Livingstone and Mr. Stanley and am looking forward to seeing Victoria Falls, the name of the spectacular falls on the Zambezi River given by Dr. Livingstone. The previous indigenous name had been &ldquo;Mosi-oa-Tunya&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The Smoke that Thunders.&rdquo; I read also that Dr. Livingstone died looking for the source of the Nile, and his heart was excised from his body and buried in Zambia, while his body was taken overland and then by boat back to England.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Tuesday, July 3</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>enjoyed a delicious buffet breakfast in the Summer Sun hotel restaurant, really good! Also in the large restaurant were a number of busloads of S. African school children&mdash;showing fine behavior and enjoying their food. We wondered where they came from and how it was arranged that came to eat at this hotel.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>took the shuttle back to the O.R. Tamba airport and went through the security and other check ins there. I bought a zebra print tie and Hana bought a belt, she had forgotten to bring one along. The airport in J-burg is highly organized and efficient, no problems at all. We saw a sign advertising Bankers without Borders and wondered what kind of an organization that was. Our flight was upgraded to business class, so we basked in the luxury of more leg room, better food and service, more smiles from the stewardesses, etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>we approached Livingstone, Zambia, we could see the Victoria Falls from the air, fanning out as the Zambezi River approached the broad drop off. It is on the border of Zimbabwe with Zambia, and we planned to explore it from the Zambian side. Our home base was to be a rustic hotel/hostel called Jollyboys. We landed at Harry Mwaanga Knumbula International Airport. The bathrooms signs said Ladies and Gents. After changing money ($ 100 US = 500,000 Zambian kwacha&mdash;a kwacha is the Zambian fish eagle, the national bird) we took the shuttle bus to our hotel. Jollyboys has private rooms, all at ground level and also spaces for tents. The rooms were very basic&mdash;cold showers, mosquito nets over the beds, no AC. During the latter part of our stay a high school group from S. Africa pitched their tents&mdash;about 10 tents for maybe thirty young adults, generally well behaved&mdash;in the courtyard of the hotel. The staff was helpful and it was just the kind of place that we were hoping for.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jollyboys (we never did find out where that name comes from) receptionist called a cab for us&mdash;the cabbie was named Victor&mdash;and he drove us to the Victoria Falls. When he dropped us off we set up a time when he would meet us again, at the end of the day. Surprisingly to us, there weren&rsquo;t hordes of tourists. I guess the &ldquo;off-the-beaten-track&rdquo; nature of the Falls explained that. It was spectacular. The bottled water sold at the stands was called &ldquo;Taste the Thunder.&rdquo; And the Falls certainly did thunder. The water falls over 108 meters and the expanse of the Falls, spreading from Zambia to Zimbabwe, was almost 2 km distance. There are 8-9 separate falls, and the full distance across at the rim is about nine kilometers. It is hard to see the whole falls from one end to the other.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ruth, Hana and I hiked along a trail overlooking the gorge in which the Falls descends and got lots of photos. The woodlands beside the trail was habitat for a bunch of chimpanzees who call that area their home. We were warned not to get out any food during this hike because these hungry chimps try to steal it and get aggressive doing so.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other hikes we took included one that involved a steep descent into what was called the Boiling Pot. It has this name because the torrents of water form a cauldron of sorts at the base, the water swirls and seems to boil. Of course, the noise was deafening.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We also took a hike along the Knife&rsquo;s Edge, a path and suspension bridge right along the falls. We rented rain ponchos but in spite of those ponchos we still got plenty wet. The rainbows were constant and we got a lot of photos again, risking getting our camera&rsquo;s wet!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>After perusing the strip of souvenir shops (and owners insistently pursuing our business) Victor brought us back to the hotel. We had supper there, fairly tired after the day of hiking and remarking on the incredible views we had of these Falls. Even Ruth, having grown up in Africa, had not yet seen them. The weather was cool (this was &ldquo;winter&rdquo; in the southern hemisphere) so the Knife&rsquo;s Edge hike had chilled us. We had some hot tea which helped.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The hotel restaurant had the tv on, showing Zambian news. One of the news features was a visit that George W. and Laura Bush were making to Zambia to open up a health clinic. Another news story had to do with plans to &ldquo;re-base the kwacha&rdquo;, that is, take three zeros off of the various denominations. Yet another story that was big was about a copper scandal&mdash;copper is a major export of Zambia, which shares the copper belt with Congo.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our plans for next day, we decided, would be to go on a safari in Botswana to see some large African animals. We signed up at the Jollyboys desk.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Wednesday, July 4</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We were picked up early in the morning and, half asleep with passports in hand, and took a bus ride westward along the border of Zambia and Zimbabwe. We arrived at a ferry crossing town (it reminded me of Neak Loeung in Cambodia&mdash;rough, dusty, full of enterprising people all either trying to get across the river on the ferry or trying to make money from the people who were waiting to cross). This location was right at the point where four African countries come together, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Namibia and</p>

<p>Andy drove us to Dulles, with Carla helping in the navigation. This was practice for our plans for him to pick us on at the end of July. There was a (sort of gruesome) motorcycle accident on I-83 that we passed on the way which put me a bit on edge. There were still lots of tree branches, etc. remaining to drive around as we left the neighborhood and many traffic lights out. Andy did a good job driving us and he will have the GPS when he comes again to get us.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At Dulles we found a Chipotle restaurant and Hana was happy to get her belly full of burrito before taking off for Johannesburg. She also got a chance to watch the ending of the Spain-Italy European cup soccer match which her team, Spain, won handily. I spoke with my friend, Tom Openshaw, in the airport before taking off. He noted that we must have &ldquo;nerves of steel&rdquo; to leave our three young adult children at home for a month. Maybe so. . . .</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The flight went well and, after a re-fueling stop in Dakar, Senegal (where we weren&rsquo;t allowed to get off the plane) we made it to Johannesburg in about 17 hours total. After we landed, the pilot announced that it had been a &ldquo;fully automated landing.&rdquo; I am sure that it was a safe landing, using the computers instead of a pilot, but I am glad that they waited until we were on the ground to announce it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our flight from Dulles had been pushed back several hours, meaning that we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to catch the flight to Zambia immediately from Johannesburg as we had planned. South African Airlines put us up in a hotel near the airport and arranged a flight the next day, and it all worked out. We stayed at the Summer Sun hotel and rugby was on tv in the lobby. Sports seem to be of above average importance in South Africa. Bruno Baerg, Southern Africa MCC Area Director, came by to greet us and to pick up a suitcase that we wouldn&rsquo;t need in Zambia.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We noticed on Weather.com that the forecast for Baltimore for the next five days predicted highs of 98/99/102/98/97. Johannesburg is cool, it is the &ldquo;winter&rdquo; here and we pitied the folks we left behind on the east coast.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Monday, July 2</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because of the time changes, we arrived in J-burg on Monday evening, July 2 at the O.R. Tamba airport. Ruth and I took a walk along the streets near the hotel, not a wonderful scenic walk but we got outside and I enjoyed breathing the air of Africa for the first time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I read about Dr. Livingstone and Mr. Stanley and am looking forward to seeing Victoria Falls, the name of the spectacular falls on the Zambezi River given by Dr. Livingstone. The previous indigenous name had been &ldquo;Mosi-oa-Tunya&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The Smoke that Thunders.&rdquo; I read also that Dr. Livingstone died looking for the source of the Nile, and his heart was excised from his body and buried in Zambia, while his body was taken overland and then by boat back to England.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Tuesday, July 3</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>enjoyed a delicious buffet breakfast in the Summer Sun hotel restaurant, really good! Also in the large restaurant were a number of busloads of S. African school children&mdash;showing fine behavior and enjoying their food. We wondered where they came from and how it was arranged that came to eat at this hotel.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>took the shuttle back to the O.R. Tamba airport and went through the security and other check ins there. I bought a zebra print tie and Hana bought a belt, she had forgotten to bring one along. The airport in J-burg is highly organized and efficient, no problems at all. We saw a sign advertising Bankers without Borders and wondered what kind of an organization that was. Our flight was upgraded to business class, so we basked in the luxury of more leg room, better food and service, more smiles from the stewardesses, etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>we approached Livingstone, Zambia, we could see the Victoria Falls from the air, fanning out as the Zambezi River approached the broad drop off. It is on the border of Zimbabwe with Zambia, and we planned to explore it from the Zambian side. Our home base was to be a rustic hotel/hostel called Jollyboys. We landed at Harry Mwaanga Knumbula International Airport. The bathrooms signs said Ladies and Gents. After changing money ($ 100 US = 500,000 Zambian kwacha&mdash;a kwacha is the Zambian fish eagle, the national bird) we took the shuttle bus to our hotel. Jollyboys has private rooms, all at ground level and also spaces for tents. The rooms were very basic&mdash;cold showers, mosquito nets over the beds, no AC. During the latter part of our stay a high school group from S. Africa pitched their tents&mdash;about 10 tents for maybe thirty young adults, generally well behaved&mdash;in the courtyard of the hotel. The staff was helpful and it was just the kind of place that we were hoping for.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jollyboys (we never did find out where that name comes from) receptionist called a cab for us&mdash;the cabbie was named Victor&mdash;and he drove us to the Victoria Falls. When he dropped us off we set up a time when he would meet us again, at the end of the day. Surprisingly to us, there weren&rsquo;t hordes of tourists. I guess the &ldquo;off-the-beaten-track&rdquo; nature of the Falls explained that. It was spectacular. The bottled water sold at the stands was called &ldquo;Taste the Thunder.&rdquo; And the Falls certainly did thunder. The water falls over 108 meters and the expanse of the Falls, spreading from Zambia to Zimbabwe, was almost 2 km distance. There are 8-9 separate falls, and the full distance across at the rim is about nine kilometers. It is hard to see the whole falls from one end to the other.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ruth, Hana and I hiked along a trail overlooking the gorge in which the Falls descends and got lots of photos. The woodlands beside the trail was habitat for a bunch of chimpanzees who call that area their home. We were warned not to get out any food during this hike because these hungry chimps try to steal it and get aggressive doing so.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other hikes we took included one that involved a steep descent into what was called the Boiling Pot. It has this name because the torrents of water form a cauldron of sorts at the base, the water swirls and seems to boil. Of course, the noise was deafening.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We also took a hike along the Knife&rsquo;s Edge, a path and suspension bridge right along the falls. We rented rain ponchos but in spite of those ponchos we still got plenty wet. The rainbows were constant and we got a lot of photos again, risking getting our camera&rsquo;s wet!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>After perusing the strip of souvenir shops (and owners insistently pursuing our business) Victor brought us back to the hotel. We had supper there, fairly tired after the day of hiking and remarking on the incredible views we had of these Falls. Even Ruth, having grown up in Africa, had not yet seen them. The weather was cool (this was &ldquo;winter&rdquo; in the southern hemisphere) so the Knife&rsquo;s Edge hike had chilled us. We had some hot tea which helped.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The hotel restaurant had the tv on, showing Zambian news. One of the news features was a visit that George W. and Laura Bush were making to Zambia to open up a health clinic. Another news story had to do with plans to &ldquo;re-base the kwacha&rdquo;, that is, take three zeros off of the various denominations. Yet another story that was big was about a copper scandal&mdash;copper is a major export of Zambia, which shares the copper belt with Congo.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our plans for next day, we decided, would be to go on a safari in Botswana to see some large African animals. We signed up at the Jollyboys desk.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Wednesday, July 4</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We were picked up early in the morning and, half asleep with passports in hand, and took a bus ride westward along the border of Zambia and Zimbabwe. We arrived at a ferry crossing town (it reminded me of Neak Loeung in Cambodia&mdash;rough, dusty, full of enterprising people all either trying to get across the river on the ferry or trying to make money from the people who were waiting to cross). This location was right at the point where four African countries come together, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Namibia and&nbsp;</p>

<p>Botswana. The bus let us off and we crossed on a motorboat, cutting ahead of all of the people and vehicles who were waiting for the large ferry. We got on another bus, a friendly guide named Axe introduced himself to us, and we went on to the border crossing into Botswana.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At this crossing there was a foot wiping station that we had to go through before going into Botswana. This was a new experience&mdash;Axe asked us &ldquo;Did you step on the mat?&rdquo; So we waited in line to wipe our feet on a mat that had been treated with some kind of chemical. The sign said that by wiping our feet we were trying to stop the spread of Foot and Mouth disease. One lady had a huge bag of shoes and she had to dump the entire bag out on the ground and painstakingly wipe each shoe, one by one, on the mat.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At one point on the road near the river crossing, there was a junction that pointed straight ahead to Botswana, right for Namibia and left for Zimbabwe.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We arrived at the safari location, Chobe park, a huge game preserve, 11,700 square km in size in the NE corner of Botswana. It is a part of the Kalahari desert. After a breakfast we took a boat ride on the Chobe river. The Chobe river empties into the mighty Zambezi. Across the Chobe was Namibia, a formerly German colony. The guide told us about a 2007 dispute, resolved by the International Criminal Court, between Botswana and Namibia. Both countries claimed an island in the Chobe river. I forget how this was resolved.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the afternoon we took to the roads and were driven in a large open jeep. The wildlife was tremendous and everywhere&mdash;Nile crocodiles, many different kinds of birds&mdash;Egyptian geese, snake bird, African skimmer, crested barbet, helmeted guinea fowl, marabou stork, lapped faced vulture, lilac crested roller&mdash;hippos, giraffes, zebras, cape water buffalo, banded mongoose, baboons, warthogs, elephants (huge herds of them), many kinds of antelope&mdash;lechwe, impalas, gnus, waterbuck, kudus, buku (these are only found in this general area of Africa), sables. Our boat guide was named Kevin, and he helped us learn little known facts&mdash;for example, the African fish eagle (the kwacha) mates for life and when the mate dies, the remaining eagle stays solitary until they die. The most aggressive animals in the park are hippos and cape buffalo. Crocodiles have no molar teeth so they bite and swallow their prey whole. The prey sits in their bellies for a long time in a very acid environment. In fact, their entire body is very acidic so the only edible part of a Nile crocodile is their tail. Our guide pointed out a bachelor group of elephant, essentially a group of losers who lost out to the strongest elephant(s) who travel around with the females that they &ldquo;won.&rdquo; Elephants can be identified as &ldquo;left vs right handed&rdquo; based on which tusk is worn down more (it is used more). Elephants have six crops of molar teeth and they wear them down over the course of their life. When the last crop is worn down, they die because they starve, unable to chew food. We saw two fish eagles mating in the top of the tree&mdash;the guide, who has been doing this job for quite some time, was excited because this was the first time he had seen this.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the afternoon, as we travelled by road, we came upon a place where an elephant had died, and his skeleton and remains of his flesh was left on the road. Axe said that the elephant had been dead maybe a week. Even this long afterwards, the band of elephants he had belonged to were circling the dead elephant, protecting the bones and, Axe explained, grieving the loss. He called the dead elephant &ldquo;grandpa.&rdquo; Seeing the elephants gently protecting and encircling the bones and remains was touching.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At another place there were a number of mothers with a couple of little baby elephants. The babies were pestering their mothers, insisting on being fed. The mothers seemed a bit annoyed. (I am not sure how I could tell that, it just seemed that way to me.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We sometimes saw a tall tree full of roosting vultures&mdash;you could be sure from that that a dead animal of some sort was nearby. The many vultures in the tree looked sinister.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We travelled above the Chobe river and watched two elephants swimming across. The river was wide. Axe said that they were travelling to Namibia &ldquo;but without the necessary visa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>noticed how giraffes, which look around from way up high with those big eyes and long eyelashes, seem kind of spacey. They are very deliberate in their movements and run with long slow strides, covering a lot of ground quickly and gracefully. They often kneel to drink and kind of hop up when they are done. Even after doing this job for a long time, Axe became animated when he saw the group of running giraffes, smiling and saying &ldquo;those are my favorites&rdquo;.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It seemed that the game preserve is so large and the animals protected that they didn&rsquo;t mind our vehicle coming along. They would move out of the way, but not for a while sometimes. We got some photos that were pretty amazing, Hana was snapping away with her digital camera.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We arrived back at the guest house, tired, after dark.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Thursday, July 5</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the morning we slept in. In the late morning we walked into Livingstone, exiting the guest house through a rusty gate in the rear of the grounds, through someone&rsquo;s back yard and to the dusty road leading into town. We ate lunch at the Caf&eacute; Zambesi, it was a hot day. Livingstone seems refreshingly un-touristy, even though it is the nearest town in Zambia to Victoria Falls.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We walked to the souvenir market along the Main St., Hana bought a Zambian soccer jersey and we bargained for and bought some nicely carved animals. My prize purchase was a warthog, my personal Pumbaa. They took out the tusks so they wouldn&rsquo;t get lost or broken, and I put them in my wallet for safekeeping. Ruth had heard that sellers in the market are willing to trade items brought from the US for their goods. When Ruth tried to trade some items she had, the market lady leaned over and whispered&mdash;&ldquo;I just want money.&rdquo; We proceeded to some other markets, more authentically Zambian and because the guidebook recommended one called the Maramba market, we asked someone in a shop to draw a map for us. He was very helpful with his detailed map, drawing all the streets, marking them with &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;No&rdquo; depending on whether we were or weren&rsquo;t supposed to take them. It was about a km away and the walk was hot, so we enjoyed the cold drink when we arrived. We also bought a bunch of tomatoes (nice red tomatoes looked delicious piled in the market stalls), some onions and buns and some raw peanuts and bananas to take back for supper.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>After we took a taxi back to Jollyboys we had our feast of tomato and onion sandwiches, bananas and peanuts. Vegetarian, just like Hana eats all the time. Hana got on Facebook and organized her photos.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Friday, July 6</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We ordered omelets for breakfast. At the outdoors restaurant, I was wearing my Mennonite Central Committee T-shirt. A family from Lancaster was there, meeting up with their son who was finishing up a SALT term for MCC in a Zambian village. We had a good time talking and making some PA-Baltimore connections. I think their last name was Yoder.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We walked to the Museum in Livingstone. The exhibits had to do with the story of civilization in African, Zambian culture and the Dr. David Livingstone story. There were on display actual letters that he had written. He died in N. Zambia, searching for the source of the Nile River.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We headed back to the Falls, this time to take a boat ride to the top of the falls. They guaranteed that this would be safe, so we took their word for it. The boat took off from the Royal Livingstone hotel, a 5 star hotel. Low end rates were US$800, the presidential suite was US$2500 per night. That was where George W. and Laura Bush had stayed when they came to visit during the preceding week. We sat on the patio, overlooking the broad river, watching the water make its peaceful meandering way to the top of the Falls where it disappeared in a cloud of mist and a thunderous noise.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We took the ride along with some other guests to Livingstone Island just at the top of the Falls. The island that we landed on reminded me a lot of Gilligan&rsquo;s Island, and Ruth thought the same thing. We imagined what it would be like if the engines of the boat failed. I did take special note of where the oars were stowed on the boat, but didn&rsquo;t feel up to the thought of having to use them. We landed on the island and met our guide, Mr. Alpha Omega (that was what his name tag said).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>we put on rain ponchos and took off our shoes and socks and waded out into the water at the top of the Falls. It was loud and misty and it felt treacherous. I am sure that it was safe but he took us directly near the stones on the edge of the brink and we took pictures, admired the rainbows, etc. Mr. Alpha Omega said that each year four hippos and six people on average go over the edge.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>had a high tea (really it was a grand feast) with 6-8 other guests at a gazebo structure on the island. One family we met (parents and daughter) used to work for a Senator Inhof of Oklahoma (who was involved with Congo issues) but are now in the oil business in Houston. Another man, from Pretoria, S. Africa, was wearing a Springbok rugby cap. He explained the rules of rugby at great length, Hana seemed very interested.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We finally departed the island after this memorable experience, once again glad for the reliable engine of the motorboat.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For supper we walked, using flashlights through the dark evening, to a restaurant called Olga&rsquo;s&mdash;The Italian Corner. It is advertised as the best pizza in Zambia. And it was good. This combo restaurant/guest house/crafts shop/school is a project of an Italian NGO called CeLIM, designed to train and hire vulnerable youth (orphans, etc). The school provides training in catering, tailoring, carpentry, plumbing, computer and bricklaying. The project named in memory of Olga Diappi. <a href="http://www.olgasproject.com/">www.olgasproject.com</a>. I paid the restaurant bill with a credit card. They had just received their first credit card machine so I saw one of the young people who works there get on-the-job training. He did a good job too.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Close to the equator complete night comes swiftly. We looked for the Southern Cross in the sky and weren&rsquo;t sure if we located it or not.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>the hotel, rugby was on TV at the outside restaurant/lounge. We wrote postcards to folks. We are appreciating the personality of the Zambians we meet&mdash;easygoing, casual, spontaneous and expressive, ready and willing to help when we need it.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>That night, the high school age hostelers from S. Africa, made a ruckus when some of the girls found big bugs of some sort in their tents and some of the boys took it upon themselves to rescue the girls and destroy the bugs. This all happened at a very high volume of sound at a very late hour of the night. It woke us up but it was fun to listen to.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Saturday, July 7</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>took the shuttle back to Nkumbula airport, the soles of my feet were still tingling from the barefoot walk on the rocks at the top of Victoria Falls. That was proof that we did such a thing, otherwise it might have felt just like a dream of some sort. also had photos to prove it. We were again upgraded to Business class&mdash;these upgrades are spoiling us&mdash;on the trip back to Johannesburg. had a good view of the Zambezi river above the Falls out of our window as we flew through the air leaving Livingstone.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hana&rsquo;s reading material during the trip back on the plane has been Sherlock Holmes mysteries (for fun) and Just and Unjust Wars for her summer school reading. I am reading Cutting for Stone by Abraham Verghese and Ruth is reading short stories by William Trevor.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bruno and Lois Baerg, MCC Area Directors overseeing southern Africa MCC programs met us at the Jo-burg airport. This airport is one of the better organized that I have been in&mdash;it seems to run very well. We enjoyed talking with them&mdash;they are from Ontario, Canada, Ruth works closely with them in her MCC role. We had supper with them and afterwards went to a 3 hour music and dance extravaganza called Africa Umoja&mdash;Spirit of Togetherness&mdash;at the Victory Theater. It was wonderful and the time</p>

<p>Botswana. The bus let us off and we crossed on a motorboat, cutting ahead of all of the people and vehicles who were waiting for the large ferry. We got on another bus, a friendly guide named Axe introduced himself to us, and we went on to the border crossing into Botswana.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At this crossing there was a foot wiping station that we had to go through before going into Botswana.

	<li>we put on rain ponchos and took off our shoes and socks and waded out into the water at the top of the Falls. It was loud and misty and it felt treacherous.

</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>had a high tea (really it was a grand feast) with 6-8 other guests at a gazebo structure on the island.

Africa, was wearing a Springbok rugby cap. He explained the rules of rugby at great length, Hana seemed very interested.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We finally departed the island after this memorable experience, once again glad for the reliable engine of the motorboat.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For supper we walked, using flashlights through the dark evening, to a restaurant called Olga&rsquo;s&mdash;The Italian Corner. It is advertised as the best pizza in Zambia. And it was good. This combo restaurant/guest house/crafts shop/school is a project of an Italian NGO called CeLIM, designed to train and hire vulnerable youth (orphans, etc). The school provides training in catering, tailoring, carpentry, plumbing, computer and bricklaying. The project named in memory of Olga Diappi. <a href="http://www.olgasproject.com/">www.olgasproject.com</a>. I paid the restaurant bill with a credit card. They had just received their first credit card machine so I saw one of the young people who works there get on-the-job training. He did a good job too.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Close to the equator complete night comes swiftly. We looked for the Southern Cross in the sky and weren&rsquo;t sure if we located it or not.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>the hotel, rugby was on TV at the outside restaurant/lounge. We wrote postcards to folks. We are appreciating the personality of the Zambians we meet&mdash;easygoing, casual, spontaneous and expressive, ready and willing to help when we need it.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>That night, the high school age hostelers from S. Africa, made a ruckus when some of the girls found big bugs of some sort in their tents and some of the boys took it upon themselves to rescue the girls and destroy the bugs. This all happened at a very high volume of sound at a very late hour of the night. It woke us up but it was fun to listen to.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Saturday, July 7</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>took the shuttle back to Nkumbula airport, the soles of my feet were still tingling from the barefoot walk on the rocks at the top of Victoria Falls. That was proof that we did such a thing, otherwise it might have felt just like a dream of some sort. also had photos to prove it. We were again upgraded to Business class&mdash;these upgrades are spoiling us&mdash;on the trip back to Johannesburg. had a good view of the Zambezi river above the Falls out of our window as we flew through the air leaving Livingstone.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hana&rsquo;s reading material during the trip back on the plane has been Sherlock Holmes mysteries (for fun) and Just and Unjust Wars for her summer school reading. I am reading Cutting for Stone by Abraham Verghese and Ruth is reading short stories by William Trevor.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bruno and Lois Baerg, MCC Area Directors overseeing southern Africa MCC programs met us at the Jo-burg airport. This airport is one of the better organized that I have been in&mdash;it seems to run very well. We enjoyed talking with them&mdash;they are from Ontario, Canada, Ruth works closely with them in her MCC role. We had supper with them and afterwards went to a 3 hour music and dance extravaganza called Africa Umoja&mdash;Spirit of Togetherness&mdash;at the Victory Theater. It was wonderful and the time</p>

<p>Botswana. The bus let us off and we crossed on a motorboat, cutting ahead of all of the people and vehicles who were waiting for the large ferry. We got on another bus, a friendly guide named Axe introduced himself to us, and we went on to the border crossing into Botswana.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At this crossing there was a foot wiping station that we had to go through before going into Botswana. This was a new experience&mdash;Axe asked us &ldquo;Did you step on the mat?&rdquo; So we waited in line to wipe our feet on a mat that had been treated with some kind of chemical. The sign said that by wiping our feet we were trying to stop the spread of Foot and Mouth disease. One lady had a huge bag of shoes and she had to dump the entire bag out on the ground and painstakingly wipe each shoe, one by one, on the mat.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At one point on the road near the river crossing, there was a junction that pointed straight ahead to Botswana, right for Namibia and left for Zimbabwe.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We arrived at the safari location, Chobe park, a huge game preserve, 11,700 square km in size in the NE corner of Botswana. It is a part of the Kalahari desert. After a breakfast we took a boat ride on the Chobe river. The Chobe river empties into the mighty Zambezi. Across the Chobe was Namibia, a formerly German colony. The guide told us about a 2007 dispute, resolved by the International Criminal Court, between Botswana and Namibia. Both countries claimed an island in the Chobe river. I forget how this was resolved.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the afternoon we took to the roads and were driven in a large open jeep. The wildlife was tremendous and everywhere&mdash;Nile crocodiles, many different kinds of birds&mdash;Egyptian geese, snake bird, African skimmer, crested barbet, helmeted guinea fowl, marabou stork, lapped faced vulture, lilac crested roller&mdash;hippos, giraffes, zebras, cape water buffalo, banded mongoose, baboons, warthogs, elephants (huge herds of them), many kinds of antelope&mdash;lechwe, impalas, gnus, waterbuck, kudus, buku (these are only found in this general area of Africa), sables. Our boat guide was named Kevin, and he helped us learn little known facts&mdash;for example, the African fish eagle (the kwacha) mates for life and when the mate dies, the remaining eagle stays solitary until they die. The most aggressive animals in the park are hippos and cape buffalo. Crocodiles have no molar teeth so they bite and swallow their prey whole. The prey sits in their bellies for a long time in a very acid environment. In fact, their entire body is very acidic so the only edible part of a Nile crocodile is their tail. Our guide pointed out a bachelor group of elephant, essentially a group of losers who lost out to the strongest elephant(s) who travel around with the females that they &ldquo;won.&rdquo; Elephants can be identified as &ldquo;left vs right handed&rdquo; based on which tusk is worn down more (it is used more). Elephants have six crops of molar teeth and they wear them down over the course of their life. When the last crop is worn down, they die because they starve, unable to chew food. We saw two fish eagles mating in the top of the tree&mdash;the guide, who has been doing this job for quite some time, was excited because this was the first time he had seen this.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the afternoon, as we travelled by road, we came upon a place where an elephant had died, and his skeleton and remains of his flesh was left on the road. Axe said that the elephant had been dead maybe a week. Even this long afterwards, the band of elephants he had belonged to were circling the dead elephant, protecting the bones and, Axe explained, grieving the loss. He called the dead elephant &ldquo;grandpa.&rdquo; Seeing the elephants gently protecting and encircling the bones and remains was touching.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At another place there were a number of mothers with a couple of little baby elephants. The babies were pestering their mothers, insisting on being fed. The mothers seemed a bit annoyed. (I am not sure how I could tell that, it just seemed that way to me.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We sometimes saw a tall tree full of roosting vultures&mdash;you could be sure from that that a dead animal of some sort was nearby. The many vultures in the tree looked sinister.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We travelled above the Chobe river and watched two elephants swimming across. The river was wide. Axe said that they were travelling to Namibia &ldquo;but without the necessary visa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>noticed how giraffes, which look around from way up high with those big eyes and long eyelashes, seem kind of spacey. They are very deliberate in their movements and run with long slow strides, covering a lot of ground quickly and gracefully. They often kneel to drink and kind of hop up when they are done. Even after doing this job for a long time, Axe became animated when he saw the group of running giraffes, smiling and saying &ldquo;those are my favorites&rdquo;.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It seemed that the game preserve is so large and the animals protected that they didn&rsquo;t mind our vehicle coming along. They would move out of the way, but not for a while sometimes. We got some photos that were pretty amazing, Hana was snapping away with her digital camera.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We arrived back at the guest house, tired, after dark.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Thursday, July 5</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the morning we slept in. In the late morning we walked into Livingstone, exiting the guest house through a rusty gate in the rear of the grounds, through someone&rsquo;s back yard and to the dusty road leading into town. We ate lunch at the Caf&eacute; Zambesi, it was a hot day. Livingstone seems refreshingly un-touristy, even though it is the nearest town in Zambia to Victoria Falls.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We walked to the souvenir market along the Main St., Hana bought a Zambian soccer jersey and we bargained for and bought some nicely carved animals. My prize purchase was a warthog, my personal Pumbaa. They took out the tusks so they wouldn&rsquo;t get lost or broken, and I put them in my wallet for safekeeping. Ruth had heard that sellers in the market are willing to trade items brought from the US for their goods. When Ruth tried to trade some items she had, the market lady leaned over and whispered&mdash;&ldquo;I just want money.&rdquo; We proceeded to some other markets, more authentically Zambian and because the guidebook recommended one called the Maramba market, we asked someone in a shop to draw a map for us. He was very helpful with his detailed map, drawing all the streets, marking them with &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;No&rdquo; depending on whether we were or weren&rsquo;t supposed to take them. It was about a km away and the walk was hot, so we enjoyed the cold drink when we arrived. We also bought a bunch of tomatoes (nice red tomatoes looked delicious piled in the market stalls), some onions and buns and some raw peanuts and bananas to take back for supper.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>After we took a taxi back to Jollyboys we had our feast of tomato and onion sandwiches, bananas and peanuts. Vegetarian, just like Hana eats all the time. Hana got on Facebook and organized her photos.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Friday, July 6</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We ordered omelets for breakfast. At the outdoors restaurant, I was wearing my Mennonite Central Committee T-shirt. A family from Lancaster was there, meeting up with their son who was finishing up a SALT term for MCC in a Zambian village. We had a good time talking and making some PA-Baltimore connections. I think their last name was Yoder.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We walked to the Museum in Livingstone. The exhibits had to do with the story of civilization in African, Zambian culture and the Dr. David Livingstone story. There were on display actual letters that he had written. He died in N. Zambia, searching for the source of the Nile River.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We headed back to the Falls, this time to take a boat ride to the top of the falls. They guaranteed that this would be safe, so we took their word for it. The boat took off from the Royal Livingstone hotel, a 5 star hotel. Low end rates were US$800, the presidential suite was US$2500 per night. That was where George W. and Laura Bush had stayed when they came to visit during the preceding week. We sat on the patio, overlooking the broad river, watching the water make its peaceful meandering way to the top of the Falls where it disappeared in a cloud of mist and a thunderous noise.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We took the ride along with some other guests to Livingstone Island just at the top of the Falls. The island that we landed on reminded me a lot of Gilligan&rsquo;s Island, and Ruth thought the same thing. We imagined what it would be like if the engines of the boat failed. I did take special note of where the oars were stowed on the boat, but didn&rsquo;t feel up to the thought of having to use them. We landed on the island and met our guide, Mr. Alpha Omega (that was what his name tag said).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>we put on rain ponchos and took off our shoes and socks and waded out into the water at the top of the Falls. It was loud and misty and it felt treacherous. I am sure that it was safe but he took us directly near the stones on the edge of the brink and we took pictures, admired the rainbows, etc. Mr. Alpha Omega said that each year four hippos and six people on average go over the edge.</li>
